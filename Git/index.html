    <h1>Git & Github</h1>
    <p>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.<br />source: https://git-scm.com/</p>
    <p>GitHub is the largest code host on the planet with over 23.5 million repositories. Large or small, every repository comes with the same powerful tools. These tools are open to the community for public projects and secure for private projects.<br />source: https://github.com/features</p>

    <p>Create a <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a> account.</p>
    <p>Login. Create a new repository.</p>
    <img src="../img/new-repository.png" />
    <p>Copy your repository's URL.</p>
    <img src="../img/github-url.png" />
    <p>Open Git Bash from the Start Menu.</p>
    <p>Create a new directory on the H: drive. Call it git.</p>
    <p><code>cd /h/
      <br />mkdir git
      <br />cd git</code></p>
    <p>Clone your project.</p>
    <p><code>git clone &lt;your url goes here&gt; &lt;your name goes here&gt;</code></p>
    <p>Next, we start adding project files. For example, you can continue working on the GameController class.</p>
    <p>Open Processing. Go to File > Save As. Name your project GameController and save it in the same location as your Git repository (on the H: drive).</p>
